# drawing-and-animations

Drawings and animations using p5, there's no practical application for this, just thought it would be fun to make.

1. A day night cycle with the sun/moon travelling along a parabola and the star filled night sky.

2. That nostalgic DVD screensaver with the icon that bounces when it reaches the edge.
